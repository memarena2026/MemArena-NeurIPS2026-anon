# eval_cleanup_watchdog.sh — keep evaluation_results_*_4omini.json in sync
# with their underlying answer_results_*.json during a fresh reproduction
# run.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# The canonical run_judge.sh has a "is this trial judged?" gate that is
# satisfied purely by the existence of the corresponding
# evaluation_results_*_4omini.json file. When the runner regenerates an
# answer file, the stale paper-baseline eval file underneath still satisfies
# that gate, so the runner-triggered post-trial judge silently no-ops and
# the eval stays stale. This watchdog deletes any eval whose underlying
# answer is fresher; the next run_judge.sh run then sees the trial as
# unjudged and produces a fresh eval.
#
# Race-safety with non-atomic writes
# ----------------------------------
# eval/src/io.write_json is open+truncate+write (NOT tmp+rename), so a
# concurrent unlink of a half-written eval is theoretically possible.
# Mitigation: the SETTLE_SECS guard below — we only delete an eval whose
# mtime is at least SETTLE_SECS old. Eval files are tiny (~1 MB JSON);
# a fully written eval lands within milliseconds, so a 60 s guard
# eliminates the window without slowing us down meaningfully.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   bash scripts/reproduce/eval_cleanup_watchdog.sh
#   nohup bash scripts/reproduce/eval_cleanup_watchdog.sh > /tmp/memarena_eval_cleanup.log 2>&1 &
#
# Stop with: pkill -f eval_cleanup_watchdog.sh
