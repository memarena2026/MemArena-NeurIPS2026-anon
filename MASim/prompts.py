FORMAT TOLERANCE — the following differences are NOT errors:
- Slug vs display name: "elijah_ward" == "Elijah Ward"
- Date/time format differences: "Day 3.2" == "on day three" == "the third day"
- Prose summary vs raw metadata: model summarising the gold value in natural
  language is CORRECT as long as the key fact is preserved.
- Extra context: the model adding surrounding detail is fine if the core fact
  is present.
- Paraphrasing: different wording conveying the same meaning is correct.

VERDICT — return one of three labels:
  "correct"   — the prediction captures the key fact(s) from the evidence/gold
  "incorrect" — the prediction is factually wrong, contradicts evidence/gold,

  "uncertain" — you cannot confidently decide (ambiguous, partially correct,
